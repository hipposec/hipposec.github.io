After my last posting about the Explore Scientific Dobsonian, I ended up deciding to return it and convinced my wife we should spend the money (almost 3x as much) on a Celestron Nexstar 8SE. This is a 8 inch Schmidt-Cassegrain with a 2030mm focal length. Even though it was a little smaller, I really liked being back on a tripod.

Unfortunately the scope ended up having some issues and ultimately went back to Celestron for repair. During this time of troubleshooting and then sending it back, I got a bit lazy and only started taking out my binoculars. I consider this a blessing, because I now consider binocular astronomy a blast. I see binoculars recommended to first timers a lot, but I think no matter how long you’ve been doing amateur astronomy you should give it a shot if you haven’t before.

Here’s what I’m loving about binoculars:

There’s no setup. Just a pair of binoculars and a zero gravity chair is all I need. This makes it much easier if I get out there and some clouds roll in, or I just decide its too cold. Similarly, they are easy to take on your travels, especially if you get ones that don’t require a tripod.

You can lay back and take in the sky completely, then very easily put binoculars up to your eyes to explore a specific area a little deeper. No fiddling with a finder scope, computerized motors, or squatting to eyepiece height. Also binoculars point pretty naturally as the image is “straight through” compared to a telescope that often has the eyepiece at a 90 degree angle to the image.

Binoculars have a wide angle of view that make it really easy to navigate the sky.

And most of all, the ease of which you can just scan the sky under magnification means you can lay out there and “discover” objects in the sky. I’ve had many experiences where I’m just looking around and I stumble across a Messier object. I live in a Bortle 7 area so a lot of objects aren’t visible for me, but scanning with binoculars lets me build a list of things to view with the 8in SCT later, knowing that they’re visible with my light pollution.

For my next post I’ll talk a little bit about the binoculars I’ve been using and my thoughts on them. But for now, if you’ve got any pair of binoculars laying around I’d suggest giving them a shot.
