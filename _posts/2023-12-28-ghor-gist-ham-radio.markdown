This is an intro post to a running series I try to simplify ham radio concepts.

Why?

For a few reasons:

1. Writing it helps me retain it. That's a keypoint if you're going to spend any time reading this, this is 50/50 for myself and other people. Everything should be considered with the caveat of being what I've learned so far, meaning you shouldn't assume it's the whole story.

2. It seems that a lot of content around radio starts with "In 1752 Ben Franklin flew a kite to learn about electricity" then goes on for 12 pages to "In conclusion you should just turn down the RF gain". There's certainly a place for that kind of background but sometimes you just want the gist of a topic to determine if you're interested in it or otherwise just need a fast answer. Some may argue that's just wanting things handed to you, but I say who cares. Worrying that people didn't work hard enough to get their knowledge is just gatekeeping. I think it'll be pretty obvious that by reading this you're not going to be an expert on anything, and you'll need to get your more in depth knowledge elsewhere.

Who are you?

Just a guy with a general class ham radio license. I'd consider myself a pretty technical person, my parents started me out with computers in the mid-90s when I was in elementary school and I just ran with it. When I finished college I started a career in cyber security. I had some interest in scanning and CB radio in the early 2000s and actually went as far as getting my tech license, but never quite got around to buying the radio. In 2019 I heard about the RTL-SDR which then led to shortwave, gmrs and finally ham radio. I got my tech license again in early 2021 and upgade to General shortly after. I haven't yet decided if the Extra class is worth the effort for me.
