I recently read a blog post, [The Four Hobbies, and Apparent Expertise](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/04/20/hobbies.html) that really stuck with me.

Thinking about that posting, I’ve come to realize one of the first things I do when exploring a new hobby is get into the gear and start hanging out on a relevant forum (or subreddit). Part of this is necessary because it’s one of the ways I start learning a new topic, but far too often I don’t transition into the “mostly doing” phase of the hobby. This ends up getting me caught in a loop where I spend more time researching and buying gear than actually enhancing my skills with it. Therefore, I end up in some areas an example of time spent doesn’t equal experience.
