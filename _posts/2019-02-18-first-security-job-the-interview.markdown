The point of this series has been to provide direction to a new security practitioner who may have gained knowledge through college or certifications and is now trying to turn that into a career. As the closing chapter I wanted to give advice on interviewing for the job based on my experiences from both sides of the table.

* Familiarize yourself with the job posting and do your best to understand what’s being discussed in every responsibility or requirement. If there’s a topic you don’t recognize, go read about it. Showing a familiarity with a topic indicates you’re prepared and interested in the position, but don’t try to oversell yourself as an expert after reading a Wikipedia article.
* There is a lot of free tools and knowledge out there that likely was not covered in college, which is what I’ve tried to highlight in this series. Being able to show you’ve taken the initiative to expand your skills beyond the academic sense will likely put you ahead of the pack.
* Most people will of course cast their experience in a favorable light on their resume, perhaps to the point of outright lying. One goal of the interview will be trying to determine to what degree you may have exaggerated your experience. If there’s anything on your resume you’re not comfortable expanding on with a few sentences then it probably doesn’t belong there. In fact, my method for preparing for an interview is to take each bullet point on my resume and writing several sentences about it to refresh my memory.
* If you don’t know an answer, just say so. Or at least preface your answer with “I’m not certain, but I think…”. Someone who is confidently wrong can be worse than someone who doesn’t know.
* Don’t be afraid to shift the answer to a question from your weakness to a strength. For example, if you were young in your career but asked about a time you handled a major security incident you might say “I have not yet experienced handling a major incident, however in college I did take a course in analyzing malware”
* Often times there are multiple interviews or a phone screen. Use each interaction with the employer to understand what they’re looking for and brush up your knowledge in that area accordingly.
* Simple things matter. In an interview you’re saying to the employer “This is my best effort to impress you”. So be on time, turn off your cellphone, dress appropriately, use appropriate language, and come prepared. But if you botch one of those don’t let it blow your confidence and affect the rest of the interview.

Good luck in your career search!
