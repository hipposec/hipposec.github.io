It’s no secret that the defensive side of security is fast moving and can be overwhelming. The speed at which new attacks are created and matured and the constantly expanding attack surface means that security professionals have to refresh their knowledge on a daily basis. One way to keep up to date and be a contributor to the industry is through information sharing.

According to CISA[1], information sharing enables informed decision making in day to day actions (situational awareness), risk management actions to anticipated threats, and strategic planning or investments. Put another way, sharing creates a collective body of wisdom to help determine what security practitioners should be looking for as threats today and how they should be planning for the future.  By leveraging the experience of others, we can respond more rapidly to new threats and see what preventative measures warrant the effort and investment.

Why don’t more organizations participate? Most likely due to concerns over reputation, privacy and trust. Organizations are typically not interested in sharing the details of incidents they have incurred or any details that might give an attacker or competitor and advantage.

Recently released research[2] investigated the human behavior aspects that go into information sharing and determined the following important factors in promoting information sharing:

* The contributors of useful information benefit from the sharing by receiving useful information in return, and to a lesser extent may be motivated by financial gain.
* The sharing of information should be as easy as possible. The more complicated it is for individuals to share, the less likely they are going to do so.
* Individuals are more likely to participate in information sharing if the information they receive can be trusted.
* Information sharing is a tactic every organization should explore to enhance their cyber security capabilities. By building relationships and sharing information across their sector, they tap into a low cost method of informing tactical and strategic decision making.
