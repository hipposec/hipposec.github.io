In March I’ll be coming up on 5 years in my first job as a CISO and really, first job with significant management responsibilities outside of interns and being a team lead.

A few things I realized during that time:

Security is much more than deploying technology and in order to be successful needs to be a factor in making many business and strategy decisions. Having a voice in these decisions is why security needs to have influence at the top levels of management. If you’re interviewing for a security management position, I think exploring this should be a priority for you as it is also a huge contributor to stress.
In management, technical chops are, at best, half the picture. You definitely need to understand the technology so that you can make decisions and communicate security to the rest of the organization. But management is an actual skillset on its own to be learned. There are lots of ways to do this, but I have particularly enjoyed the Harvard Business School Online courses around organizational leadership.
A big part of being in security is just being the person who pushes for security to be a priority so that it isn’t overlooked. Your peers in IT and around the org are (probably) not idiots or lazy, they just under different pressures. They’re focused on closing tickets, keeping systems going and making project deadlines.
