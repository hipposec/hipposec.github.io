A significant concern in the cybersecurity industry is the lack of available talent. In the Metro Atlanta area, there is only enough qualified talent to fill around 2/3rd of the jobs.

And yet at the same time I frequently see comments that cybersecurity isn’t an entry level position, and that it requires 1-2 years of helpdesk, server or other experience. I can understand this position if you are only budgeted for a couple of security positions, but if your team is larger I strongly encourage taking the risk on new talent. The following is my experience doing just that.

The key to being successful with this is to search for those that have shown that they’re willing to do more than the minimum to pass a college course. Look for those pursuing certifications or studying on their own time when no one is pushing them to so. Bonus points if they have some sort of lab at home.

When interviewing, be up front with what experience they’re going to get. I make it clear that if someone joins the team with little professional experience that we understand they’re going to be learning, but they should expect to get assigned the “grunt work” while they’re learning their way.

Once they’re on board, their growth is directly related to your investment in them. Offer them training opportunities, exposure to conferences and make sure they’re free to approach anyone they need for help. Don’t forget they might not only need technical guidance, but just overall career advice and reassurance. Check in on them from time to time too, the learning curve can be discouraging.

Lastly remember that a jump from 0 experience to some experience is major in the job market. If you want to retain your “investment” then you have to make sure the opportunity grows with them.
