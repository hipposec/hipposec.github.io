As I mentioned in my last post I was having some issues with my telescope which serendipitously led me to discovering binocular astronomy.

I’m currently switching back and forth between three pairs of binoculars:

Leupold 10×42 roof prism binoculars. I honestly didn’t plan to use these for astronomy as the aperture isn’t very large. Also as I understand it, roof prism binoculars result in a dimmer image so while more compact, they’re not as good for astronomy. I took them outside on the first night just to try them out and was quite satisfied with how well they perform. Perhaps its the light pollution in my area but I am not noticing massive differences because of the smaller aperture relative to my other binoculars, but I definitely notice the lighter weight.

Celestron 12×60 have been my go to and the ones I’d recommend to anyone who asked. They’re just a little bit more powerful than 10x50s but I don’t notice a weight difference. I’ve used these to “discover” several open clusters, look at the Pleiades and Hyades, and view nebulas (although my light polution doesn’t allow for seeing the gases in anything but the Orion Nebula). That said, 12x isn’t enough to get much out of planets. I do notice some image distortion around the edges, but for the price of $70 they’re definitely good enough.

From the same line I have the Celestron 25x70s. I have not been as happy with these. Mine showed up with collimation issues, which based on the reviews is quite common but fixable. Also the bracket holding the eyepieces frequently gets crooked, leaving one eyepiece further out of focus than the other. When I’m not having these problems, they are decent but with the same distortion in the 12x60s. Between the more narrow field of view (around 2.2 degrees vs. the 5 degrees of the 12x60s) and the weight, I dont find these to be “scanning” binoculars. Instead, I often take these outside on a sturdy video camera tripod, use my 12x60s to scan the sky and then switch to these if I find something interesting. For Christmas I’m getting a pair of Oberwerk 20x80s that I anticipate to have higher optical quality and will replace these in my lineup.

Speaking of tripods, besides being a nice addition with heavier binoculars, remember that they also allow you to point the binoculars at an object then let someone else take a look. This is nice if you’re gazing with someone who is less experienced (or perhaps, less interested).

With few exceptions, if you’re getting started in this hobby and don’t have at least $500 to spend on a telescope, I’d suggest the Celestron 12x60s. If it turns out you don’t really get into the hobby, they can be repurposed for landscape viewing and you’re not out that much money.
