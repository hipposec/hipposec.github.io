This is my review of the Explore Scientific 10 inch truss tube dobsonian available from Costco as item number 1360268. As of 8/23/2022 it is $599.The model is DOB1045C.

I’ve had this telescope for about a week. This is my third serious telescope in about 25 years of on again off again amateur astronomy and first dobsonian. While I am enjoying this telescope alot, I am not sure that I’d recommend this as a first telescope. There are some challenges that I worry a newcomer to amateur astronomy would find discouraging enough to abandon the hobby. If you are just getting into astronomy, binoculars or a simple refractor might be a better place to start.

First, I ordered mine in August of 2022 and it came with the moon map, 2 eye pieces, eye piece camera, planisphere, and the 2 inch to 1.25 inch eyepiece adapter. It arrived quickly and was fairly easy to assemble, although I did have the metal shavings in the rocker box which I see mentioned quite often with this brand.

Tip: it matters how you overlap the truss tubes. If the screws do not go in to the upper assembly easily, you probably have one of them reversed.

Out of the box the only real issue of concern is the finder scope. It feels very cheaply made and is a bit difficult to use at times due to how close it is to the telescope. I replaced mine with a telrad finder, but this has its own challenges. While the telrad or other red dot scope makes finding a visible object such as the moon or a planet really easy, it can be hard to find faint objects because you go from 0x magnification in the finder to at least 50x in the scope. Meaning, in the telescope eyepiece you’ll see a lot of stars you don’t see with your naked eye, and thus it can be difficult to navigate. I think having a telrad available for quick location of bright objects, but then switching to a 8×50 RACI finder scope will make things a lot easier and thus I have one on order.

I live in the southeast US, so in the summer humidity is an issue. With this telescope I have to put it in my garage for at least an hour before I want to observe so it can adjust to the temperature. Otherwise, the mirror will fog from the condensation. This is not a major inconvenience, but it does mean I have to do a little more planning of my night.

This is a short telescope. I’m 5ft 11 and it seems the planets and moon are often at just the right height so that I have to kneel to look through the finder scope and then sit on the ground to look through the eyepiece. A lot of dobsonian owners build a platform or use blocks to raise the base and I’ll need to do the same.

Being a reflector, you’ll have to learn how to collimate the mirrors. This seems difficult the first time you do it, but then gets easy. I highly recommend a laser collimation tool. You may have to do this every night, and definitely will have to do it every time you reassemble the scope. Getting this right is especially important when viewing planets. The center is marked on the primary mirror which helps with this process.

I realize most of my review is pointing out negatives, but I do that only to help set expectations. To be honest I briefly considered returning it but when I looked for what could replace it I struggled to find anything else that offered the value for the price. At best, you might end up with a tripod mounted scope with half the aperture.
